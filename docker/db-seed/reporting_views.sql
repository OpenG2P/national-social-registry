-- NSR reporting layer
-- =============================================================================
-- Flattens the register into two wide, indexed materialized views that
-- dashboards (Superset) and the maps surface (Evidence) both read from. Charts
-- then stay simple SELECTs instead of repeating multi-table joins and JSONB
-- digging in every chart definition.
--
-- Country-agnostic by construction
-- --------------------------------
-- Geography is unpacked from geo_code_hierarchy_json BY POSITION (ordinality),
-- never by level name. A deployment with country/region/district/ward/village
-- and one with region/zone/woreda/kebele both populate geo_1..geo_n in their
-- own order, and `nsr_rpt_geo_levels` carries that deployment's actual level
-- labels so a dashboard can title the columns correctly. Nothing here assumes
-- a country, a level naming scheme, or a fixed depth.
--
-- Materialized, not plain views: the JSONB unpacking over ~1M individuals is
-- far too slow to run per chart. Refresh after a load:
--
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY nsr_rpt_household;
--   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY nsr_rpt_individual;
--
-- (CONCURRENTLY needs the unique indexes created at the bottom, and those in
-- turn need a first non-concurrent refresh — which CREATE ... AS does for us.)
-- =============================================================================

-- Level labels for this deployment, so dashboards can name geo_1..geo_5.
